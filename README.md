# TradeMon – Pokémon Card Trading Platform

**TradeMon** is a community-driven Pokémon card trading website where collectors can put cards up for trade, and exchange cards with other users. The platform makes trading simple by allowing users to browse available cards and send trade requests. When a trade is accepted, ownership is swapped automatically, creating a seamless digital trading experience.

This project was built to provide a dedicated space for Pokémon card collectors to interact, trade, and grow their collections without needing external platforms or forums.
